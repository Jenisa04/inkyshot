## Hardware required

* Raspberry Pi (tested with Zero and 3B so far)
* [Pimoroni InkyPHAT display](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/inky-phat?variant=12549254938707)
* 8GB SD Card (Sandisk Extreme Pro recommended)
* Power supply
* **Optional:** 3D printed case with [micro USB sockets](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000484202812.html)
* **Optional:** [Waveshare 2.13" e-paper display V2](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.13inch_e-Paper_HAT) (**Note:** the case designs will need modification to fit this display. Set the `WAVESHARE` environment variable to `1` to enable support)

## Setup & Installation

Running this project is as simple as deploying it to a balenaCloud application. You can do it in just one click by using the button below:

[![](https://balena.io/deploy.png)](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/deploy)

You can also deploy in the traditional manner using the balena CLI and `balena push` command. For more information [check out the docs](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/deploy/deployment/).

## Customization

Your fleet of Inkyshots can all be managed centrally via balenaCloud. Try any of the environment variables below to add some customization.

### Update time

Inkyshot wants to deliver a shot of inspiration to start your day, and by default will do this at 9AM/0900 hours UTC. You can change the hour that the update will happen with the `UPDATE_HOUR` variable; set it anywhere from `0` to `23`.

### Timezone

In order for the update time to work correctly, you'll of course have to tell Inkyshot what timezone you'd like to use. Set the `TZ` environment variable to any [IANA timezone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones), e.g. `Europe/London`, `America/Los_Angeles`, `Asia/Taipei` etc.

### Message override

Is there a special occasion in your family? Override the daily quote with a shot of celebration by setting the `INKY_MESSAGE` environment variable. Try `Happy birthday Sister!`, `Congratulations on the new job, mate!`, or `Happy mother's day!`.

### Font

There are a few fonts built in that you can try. The default is `AmaticSC`, but you can use the `FONT` variable and set it to any of: `FredokaOne`, `HankenGrotesk`, `Intuitive`, `SourceSerifPro`, `SourceSansPro`, `Caladea` and `Roboto`. You're welcome to PR more options into the project!

### Font size

Inkyshot will automatically choose the largest font size for your message that still fits on the display. Too big? Override it with the `FONT_SIZE` variable and Inkyshot will use this as a maximum and continue to resize downwards if your message doesn't fit.

### Test character

When figuring out what size font to use, Inkyshot (invisibly) fills the screen with the `a` character to see how many will fit. You can override this by setting the `TEST_CHARACTER` environment variable with any wider (`w`) or slimmer (`i`) characters of your choosing to adjust this behavior.

### Rotation

If Inkyshot is living in a different house where things aren't necessarily always the same way up, use the `ROTATE` environment variable to rotate the output by 180 degrees.

### Weather
To enable the weather display, set the environment variable `NEXT_DISPLAY` to `weather`.

Next, use either `LATLONG` (e.g. 39.9199,32.8543) or `WEATHER_LOCATION` (e.g. Ankara, Turkey) environment variables to define the location for weather information. Entering only an empty `WEATHER_LOCATION` is also sufficient and in this case Inkyshot will lookup the latitude and longitude information from device's IP address.

Set `SCALE` environment variable to `F` to display the temperature values in Fahrenheit scale. The default is Celcius scale.

Use the `WEATHER_FONT` variable to customize the font used in weather display mode.

`LOCALE` variable allows to display the date of temperature reading in any language supported by [the date library](https://arrow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#module-arrow.locales).

Set `ALTERNATE_FREQUENCY` to alternate the display mode between quote and weather. Inkyshot uses this environment variable's number value as minutes to update periodically. By default, the first display is quote mode and you can instead chose weather by setting `NEXT_DISPLAY` to `weather`.

Finally, you can choose to fix Inkyshot to display only weather. Set `NEXT_DISPLAY` to `weather`, `DISPLAY_QUOTE` to false and don't set `INKY_MESSAGE`. In this setup, inkyshot will keep updating weather information after every minutes set by `ALTERNATE_FREQUENCY`.


## Case

STL files are included within the assets folder of the project for you to 3D print your own case.

The case has two positions for a captive M3 nut, and can be fastened together with two countersunk 8mm M3 machine screws.

A position is open in the rear of the case for the use of a [micro USB PCB socket](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000484202812.html), allowing for direct connection of power to the back of a Raspberry Pi Zero.
